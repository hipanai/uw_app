# Claude Progress Log

## Project: Upwork Auto-Apply Pipeline
Build a fully automated Upwork job application system with:
- Job ingestion from Apify (2hr schedule) + Gmail alerts (real-time)
- AI pre-filtering with Claude Sonnet
- Deep extraction with Playwright + attachment handling
- Proposal generation with Opus 4.5 + extended thinking
- HeyGen video cover letter generation
- Slack approval workflow with interactive buttons
- Playwright auto-submission after approval

---

## Session 1 - 2026-01-18 (Initializer)

### Completed
- [x] Read app_spec.txt - comprehensive pipeline specification
- [x] Created feature_list.json with 100 test cases covering:
  - Phase 1: Foundation (sheets, deduplication, Gmail, pre-filter)
  - Phase 2: Extraction & Generation (Playwright, attachments, video, PDF)
  - Phase 3: Approval Flow (Slack messages, buttons, callbacks)
  - Phase 4: Submission (Playwright form filling, auth)
  - Phase 5: Polish (directive, scheduling, error handling)
  - Cross-cutting: Performance, security, style
- [x] Created init.sh setup script with:
  - Python virtual environment setup
  - Dependency installation
  - Playwright browser installation
  - Environment variable checks
- [x] Initialized git repository
- [x] Created project structure additions:
  - .tmp/ directory for intermediate files
  - .env.example template

### Existing Infrastructure (Already Present)
- `executions/` directory with:
  - upwork_apify_scraper.py (needs source field modification)
  - upwork_proposal_generator.py (needs attachment-aware updates)
  - modal_webhook.py (needs new endpoints)
  - Gmail utilities (gmail_auth.py, gmail_unified.py, etc.)
  - Google Sheets utilities (read_sheet.py, update_sheet.py, append_to_sheet.py)
- `directives/upwork_scrape_apply.md` - existing Upwork directive
- `directives/Upwork Cover Letter Template Generator.docx.md` - template reference
- requirements.txt with all dependencies

### Key Decisions Made
1. Use existing `executions/` directory (not `execution/` as in spec)
2. Feature list covers 100 test cases (within 50-200 range)
3. Test cases ordered by implementation phases
4. All tests start with passes: false

## Next Steps for Session 2

### Immediate Priority (Phase 1: Foundation)
1. Create/verify Google Sheet structure:
   - Feature #1: Upwork Job Pipeline sheet
   - Feature #2: Upwork Processed IDs sheet

2. Implement `upwork_deduplicator.py`:
   - Features #3-5: Deduplication logic

3. Implement `upwork_gmail_monitor.py`:
   - Features #6-9: Gmail monitoring

4. Implement `upwork_prefilter.py`:
   - Features #10-14: AI pre-filtering

### Scripts to Create (in order)
- [ ] upwork_deduplicator.py
- [ ] upwork_gmail_monitor.py
- [ ] upwork_prefilter.py
- [ ] upwork_deep_extractor.py
- [ ] upwork_video_script_generator.py
- [ ] upwork_heygen_video.py
- [ ] upwork_deliverable_generator.py
- [ ] upwork_boost_decider.py
- [ ] upwork_slack_approval.py
- [ ] upwork_submitter.py
- [ ] upwork_pipeline_orchestrator.py

### Scripts to Modify
- [ ] upwork_apify_scraper.py (add source field)
- [ ] upwork_proposal_generator.py (attachment-aware)
- [ ] modal_webhook.py (add /upwork/* endpoints)

### Environment Variables Needed
```
HEYGEN_API_KEY=xxx
HEYGEN_AVATAR_ID=xxx
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-xxx
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=xxx
SLACK_APPROVAL_CHANNEL=C0123456789
UPWORK_PIPELINE_SHEET_ID=xxx
UPWORK_PROCESSED_IDS_SHEET_ID=xxx
PREFILTER_MIN_SCORE=70
```
